This Flutter App records accelerometer data during cycling and uses this data to automatically predict the surface type of the driven route.
The processing of the accelerometer data and the surface prediction is accomplished with [LG04QS_Cycling](https://github.com/NilsHMeier/LG04QS_Cycling) integrated into the App as a Google Cloud Function.

This App is part of a university project called "Ground recognition via machine Learning", whose members are [NilsHMeier](https://github.com/NilsHMeier), [Lennart402](https://github.com/Lennart401) and [niggels](https://github.com/niggels).
